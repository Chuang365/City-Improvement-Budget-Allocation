# City-Improvement-Budget-Allocation

    This project is set up with Professor Xin,Wang from UW-Madison, aiming to optimiize City Improvement Budget Allocation problem through a toy sample first. 
    Using the bilevel optimization to solve basic traffic assignment model. 
    All the progress will be uploaded to this page to help people better track the development, which contexts but not limited to:

    1. Understanding basic traffic assignment model and setting up a mathematic model
    2. Learning newest and select one of the most effective bilevel algorithm method to solve such a model
    3. Establish a optimziation solution using Python to solve such a model
    4. Shareing ideas, new thoughts and questions.
